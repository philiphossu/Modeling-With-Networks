# Modeling-With-Networks
This is the project repository for our Math380 - Introduction to Mathematical Modeling course from Spring 2018 @ IIT. 

## Description of Project
In this project, we analyze how influence can be determined in a graph and describe our exploration into mathematical modeling with networks. There exist several known measures to explore the importance of a vertex in a graph, including degree centrality, betweenness centrality, etc. We will model various networks, analyze them, find who/what has the most influence in the network, and describe the reasons behind this result. We seek to combine real world scenarios with some of these mathematical ideas to accurately describe the concept of influence in graphs.
