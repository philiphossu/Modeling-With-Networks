Part 1,2

Completed
- Parse, import, and clean Erdos1 data file
- Created iGraph network model for the Erdos1 authors
- Calculated degree of each node in the network, sorted ascending and descending
- Calculated betweenness centrality of each node 
- Created interactive plot of betweeness centrality 
- Calculated closeness values for each node in the graph
- Calculated eigenvalue centrality for each node in the graph
- Detected all cliques present in the Erdos1 network
- Detected all maximum cliques present in the Erdos1 network
- Created a plot of one of the maximum clique
- Create interactive plot of eigenvalue centrality 
- Create interactive plot of closeness centrality
- Calculate eccentricity 


Plans
- Develop an influence metric 

Part 3,4

Part 5

Extra Proposal
- Parse, clean, and analyze the Erdos1 and Erdos2 author networks simultaneously 
- Compare the two networks in terms of influence to verify assumptions
